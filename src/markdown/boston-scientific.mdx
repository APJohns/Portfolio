Built documentation site for the Anatomy Design System from the ground up. Ensured code was scalable, performant, and served as an example of accessible and quality code based off of our code standards. Built out tech-stack agnostic Anatomy components. Worked collaboratively with product teams on integrating Anatomy into their own platforms.
