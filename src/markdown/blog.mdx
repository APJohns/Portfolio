I started this blog to create a space to share details about cool projects I've been working on, and any tips and tricks I learn along the way.

It's currently built with Astro. My primary goal was to get the content out into the world, so I'm in the exploration phase for the tech stack of the site itself. I'm using Astro right now because a blog is relatively simple and shouldn't need to ship a ton of Javascript. Astro strips out that Javascript and leaves you with the closest thing to static html/css I have seen from a framework. Astro also lets you use different frameworks within it, to the point of components of different frameworks on the same page. This makes Astro a really interesting tool for exploring other frameworks without having to commit to converting an entire project.
